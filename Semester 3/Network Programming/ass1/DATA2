                                                           
I'm not a lumberjack, or a Furtrader,                      
or eat blubber                                             
And I don't know Jimmy, Sally or Suzy from Canada,         
                                                           
I speak English and French, not American                   
                                                           
I believe in peacekeeping, not policing,                   
and that the beaver is a truly proud and noble animal.     
A toque is a hat,                                          
and it IS pronounced Zed,                                  
Canada is the 2nd largest land mass,                       
and the best part of North America.                        
My name is Joe...
