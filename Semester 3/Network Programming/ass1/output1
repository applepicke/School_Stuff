THE I AM CANADIAN RANT                                     
                                                           
Hey,                                                       
I'm not a lumberjack, or a Furtrader,                      
and I don't live in an igloo,                              
or eat blubber                                             
or own a dogsled.                                          
And I don't know Jimmy, Sally or Suzy from Canada,         
although I'm certain they're really, really nice.          
                                                           
I have a prime minister... not a president,                
I speak English and French, not American                   
and I pronounce it About, not A-boot.                      
                                                           
I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack,        
I believe in peacekeeping, not policing,                   
diversity not assimilation,                                
and that the beaver is a truly proud and noble animal.     
                                                           
A toque is a hat,                                          
a chesterfield is a couch,                                 
and it IS pronounced Zed,                                  
not Zee... ZED!!                                           
Canada is the 2nd largest land mass,                       
the 1st nation of hockey,                                  
and the best part of North America.                        
                                                           
My name is Joe...                                          
and...I......AM......CANADIAN!
