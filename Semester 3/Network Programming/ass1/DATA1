THE I AM CANADIAN RANT                                     
Hey,                                                       
and I don't live in an igloo,                              
or own a dogsled.                                          
although I'm certain they're really, really nice.          
I have a prime minister... not a president,                
and I pronounce it About, not A-boot.                      
I can proudly sew my country's flag on my backpack,        
diversity not assimilation,                                
                                                           
a chesterfield is a couch,                                 
not Zee... ZED!!                                           
the 1st nation of hockey,                                  
                                                           
and...I......AM......CANADIAN!                             
Thank you.
